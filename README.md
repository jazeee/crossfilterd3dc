crossfilterd3dc
===============

### A test area for crossfilter.js, d3.js and dc.js
This is a set of code to play around with genomic data using
1. crossfilter.js - a javascript library for analyzing data across different slices
2. d3.js - a javascript library to present visual graphs or data relations
3. dc.js - a javascript library that ties crossfilter and d3, in an easy to use way. (great for a lot of projects)

### Usage
1. Download, fork, clone, whatever, from https://github.com/jazeee/crossfilterd3dc
2. Compile the coffeescript into javascript. See included bat file, or run: coffee --compile --watch --output js\generated coffeescript
3. Point a web server to your source directory and browse it. (Lighttpd on Windows works for me.)

Enjoy...
