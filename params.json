(great for a lot of projects)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Download, fork, clone, whatever, from https://github.com/jazeee/crossfilterd3dc\r\n2. Compile the coffeescript into javascript. See included bat file, or run: coffee --compile --watch --output js\\generated coffeescript\r\n3. Point a web server to your source directory and browse it. (Lighttpd on Windows works for me.)\r\n\r\nEnjoy...\r\nJaz Singh","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
